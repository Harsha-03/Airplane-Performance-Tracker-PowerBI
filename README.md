## 🎯 What This Dashboard Solves

This project isn't just a visual — it's a **storytelling engine**. Each page answers one business-critical question:

1. **Overview** – What’s the big picture across flights, delays, and cancellations?
2. **Delay Reasons** – Why are flights getting delayed or canceled?
3. **Airline Comparison** – Which airlines are the worst (or best) in terms of delays?
4. **Monthly Trends** – Are certain months or seasons riskier to fly?
5. **Worst Routes** – Which airport pairs consistently underperform?
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – What actions should decision-makers take?
